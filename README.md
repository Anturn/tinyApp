# tinyApp

Introduction:
According to the requirments given by the professor, I create a simple, tiny app, that is a simple timer by 
implementing the "Chronometer" and have a image attched to the second view of the app which can be accessed
by clicking the button.

System:
App must run on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)

Usage Instruction:
Pull all the files from repository and run the app in the Android Studio (2.3.3)

Documentation:
For this project, I implement a timer by using the "Chronometer" and add some buttons which the user can 
"start" or "stop" the timer(both are bottons). Also, if click the botton down the page, the user can enter
to the next page, which shows a good picture. I use two widgets,one of which is a "botton" and the other 
is a "progressbar". The app has two views and user can transform to the second by clicking the button.
